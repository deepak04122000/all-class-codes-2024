      A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out
      sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern
      digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known
      as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of
      tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer
      that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral
      equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers
      that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or
      computer cluster.
